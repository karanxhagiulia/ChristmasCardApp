# ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„ Christmas Card App ðŸŽ„ðŸ“¬

A mobile app designed to spread holiday cheer by letting users create and send personalised Christmas cards to their contacts! Built with React Native, this app uses Expo and Firebase Authentication.

## App Overview

The **Christmas Card App** allows users to:
- Connect with contacts within the app environment.
- Design, create, and send holiday-themed Christmas cards.
- Organise received and sent cards in an easy-to-navigate interface.

## Features

- **Customizable Cards**: Users can choose from various card templates or create a card from scratch.
- **Firebase Integration**: Firebase Authentication for user management.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Tabs for easy access to "Create", "Contacts", "Your Mail", and "Settings".

## Screens and Routing
The app uses a nested layout structure with expo-router for clean navigation:

Root Layout (app/_layout.tsx): Handles the main stack navigation and initial route setup.
Tab Layout (app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx): Contains the tab navigation screens, including "Create", "Contacts", "Your Mail", and "Settings".
